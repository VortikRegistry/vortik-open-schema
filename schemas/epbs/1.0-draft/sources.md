# enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS) — Sources

## Overview

This document compiles source context and terminology support for the Vortik semantic anchor associated with `epbs.eth`.

It supports the machine-readable schema set and human-readable documentation set of the **Vortik Semantic Registry**.

This document is a research-support artifact. It is not an official Ethereum protocol specification.

---

## Registry Metadata

- **Registry:** vortik-semantic-registry
- **Registry version:** 0.6.5
- **Registry ID:** `epbs`
- **Associated ENS:** `epbs.eth`
- **Canonical term:** enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS)
- **Classification:** core
- **Status:** implementation-facing
- **Status label:** core
- **Stage:** canonical
- **Type:** primitive
- **Market priority:** high
- **Visibility:** featured

---

## Semantic Classification

Protocol-aligned anchor with strong semantic grounding.

---

## Type Interpretation

Protocol or research primitive tracked as a semantic object.

---

## Registry Role

protocol-defined proposer-builder separation with active implementation-facing relevance, commitment-based block production, signed bid flow, payload reveal semantics, and growing consensus-specs convergence

---

## Linked Files

- **Anchor document:** `anchors/epbs.md`
- **Schema:** `schemas/epbs/1.0-draft/schema.json`

---

## Naming Context

- **ENS anchor:** `epbs.eth`
- **Canonical term:** enshrined proposer-builder separation (ePBS)

The ENS name is treated as a semantic entry point.

The canonical term is treated as the technical reference used by the registry.

If the ENS name and canonical term diverge, the mismatch should be documented in the corresponding anchor document and schema naming fields.

---

## Source Policy

Sources should prioritize:

- primary EIPs
- official specifications
- client or implementation references
- Ethereum research discussions
- protocol roadmap materials
- directly relevant technical documents

Avoid treating social commentary, price speculation, or unsupported market claims as formal sources.

## Source Notes

ePBS is treated by Vortik as a core protocol-facing primitive because EIP-7732 defines Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation and maps proposer-builder separation into Ethereum's consensus-layer design. EIP-7773 lists EIP-7732 / ePBS as Scheduled for Inclusion in Glamsterdam. EIP-7773 remains Draft and currently provides no activation values for Sepolia, Holešky, or mainnet. Scheduled inclusion is not a claim of mainnet activation or finalized fork deployment.

The Ethereum Foundation's May 2026 Protocol Cluster update reports a multi-client Glamsterdam devnet with the external-builders pipeline tested end-to-end across nearly all clients. The official consensus-specs repository maintains unstable Gloas specifications and tests for ePBS-related payload attestations and payload-envelope behavior. These are implementation-facing signals, not deployment or activation claims.

This anchor is grounded in the transition from relay-mediated proposer-builder coordination toward protocol-defined proposer-builder interaction. EIP-7732 introduces in-protocol builders and the Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC); this source note treats PTC as an ePBS role/component, not as an independent registry anchor.

EIP-7732 defines the following ePBS containers and signed containers:

- `ExecutionPayloadBid`
- `SignedExecutionPayloadBid`
- `ExecutionPayloadEnvelope`
- `SignedExecutionPayloadEnvelope`

EIP-7732 describes delayed validation by decoupling consensus validation from execution validation. PTC members attest to payload timeliness without fully validating the execution payload, and execution validation is deferred until the next beacon block validation path.

The strongest semantic objects to monitor around this anchor are:

- builder
- proposer
- bid
- payload
- commitment
- signed bid
- payload reveal
- payload timeliness
- Payload Timeliness Committee (PTC)
- payload attestation
- delayed validation

These references and notes are curated to support source traceability and semantic interpretation.

They should be updated only when primary protocol references, implementation materials, or Ethereum core development discussions materially change.
